## this is a program to find a particular kind of subsequence.
## a subsequence fits the bill if it is one made by a,b and c
## in that order. These lexicons can repeat any number of times
## in the subsequence provided they do not stand out of that or
## der. What is required is to find all distict subsequences
## which exist in the array.
