### HITS Algorithm

HITS algorithm is hyperlink based ranking tool. It tries to guess the
most relevant pages not just on the number of links that a web page has
but also on the way the links are organized. It filters the most
relevant links by a series of filtering techniques. 

#### Terms

##### _Query_ 
A query is  a string which is searched in pages to find the pages
relevance w.r.t to that string.

##### _W_
W is the set of all web pages.

##### _E_
E is the set of all edges (directional) connecting web pages W.

##### _G(W,E)_
A mapping induced on the set of web pages W using edges in E.

##### _In-degree_
A parameter which indicates the number of links point *towards* the
page.

##### _Out-degree_
A parameter which indicates the number of links pointing *to other*
pages from this page.

##### _Hub_
Is a web page that *links to* a lot of authoritative web pages.

##### _Authority_
A web page that has the most relevant information to our query.
